1.  In the navigation bar, go to **Trade **
1.  In the **Asset **list in the upper-left corner of the page, select the asset pair: _CSTT/ETH (**Note**: you will only be able to trade this specific asset pair if admin has added it on the internal exchange)_
1.  Scroll down to the **Create sell order **form
1.  In the **Price per CSTT **box, enter the amount of ETH_ _you ask for 1 CSTT: _0.1 _
1.  In the **Amount of CSTT **box, enter the amount of CSTT you want to sell: _8_
1.  Check the **Total ETH **box: _0.8 (it will automatically calculate the amount of ETH you will get if the order is fulfilled)_
1.  Click **Sell **
