Commonly, you might need a secret seed for two things: log in to the offline application and [recover your account](../user-account/recover-an-account.md). To see your secret seed, you:



1.  In the navigation bar, go to **Settings**
1.  Go to **Secret seed **tab
1.  There you can see your secret seed _(**Important: **never expose your secret seed to anyone. A person who has the seed controls the account)_
