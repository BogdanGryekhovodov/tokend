# Corporate account KYC

This verification procedure allows an individual user account to be upgraded to the corporate user account. Corporate users act on behalf of the company, firm, or enterprise. Having passed this procedure a user gets the possibility to issue their own tokens on the platform _(To learn more, check [types of accounts in TokenD](../types-of-accounts/overview.md))._

Potential corporate users are required to prove the legitimacy of their acts on behalf of the legal entity. Generally, the information can be as follows _(**Note: **a user should necessarily apply the documents that confirm the provided information):_



*   The name of the company 
*   Headquarter
*   Industry _(related to the company's business)_
*   Team size
*   When the company was founded
*   Certificate of incorporation
*   Memorandum and Articles of Association
*   Etc. _(**Note**: these are all examples of the information a corporate user may need to apply during the KYC procedure. Owners of the platform define their own demands)_

An admin will later review the KYC request _(to learn more about the KYC management on the part of the admin, check users KYC management)_.
