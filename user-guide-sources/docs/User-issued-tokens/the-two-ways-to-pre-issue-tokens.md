# Token pre-issuance

When making a token creation request a corporate user defines how the pre-issuance of tokens will be provided â€“ **with **or** without additional issuance later. **


## One-time pre-issuance

**_Example:_** a corporate user has created the token with the 1000 **_max issuance amount. _**

If a user selected **I want to make additional issuance later **check box [during the token creation](./token-creation.md)**, **then all the 1000 tokens will be pre-issued automatically after admin approved the token creation request.

**_Example:_** a corporate user has created the token with the 1000 **_max issuance amount. _**

If a user cleared the **I want to make additional issuance later **check box [during the token creation](./token-creation.md), then the tokens will be pre-issued by the user manually. "Manual token pre-issuance' implies the following process:



1.  User creates the asset pre-issuance file with the help of an offline application _(to learn more, check offline application management)_
1. [User uploads the pre-issuance file to the platform](./upload-the-pre-issuance-file-to-the-platform.md)
1.  User waits for the admin approval _(the flow on the part of admin is described in user tokens management)_
