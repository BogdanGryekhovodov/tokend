# Overview

The platform is designed so that users can create their own internal market, where some of them [create crowdfunding campaigns](../Crowdfunding-campaigns/overview.md) and sell their tokens, others â€“ have an opportunity to invest in such token sales.

_**Note:** not all user accounts are provided with an opportunity to create custom tokens and put them on sale. To learn more, check [types of accounts in TokenD](../types-of-accounts/overview.md)._
