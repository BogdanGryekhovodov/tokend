# Platform customization and Application development

TokenD is a highly flexible and configurable system that greatly facilitates the implementation of various use cases by the team that shouldn’t obligingly have any experience in building the so-called DApps (Decentralized Applications). Most customizations for developing MVP solutions do not require any changes to the core of the system, which significantly reduces time to market and at the same time provides high level of security. 

Data agnostic approach allows to securely exchange custom data without the need to introduce these changes to the core module. In case of a custom KYC flow, MVP development team will only have to update client and admin facing applications, and in case of integration with external KYC processor – an auxiliary module to connect two systems. 

TokenD provides various sets of highly configurable tools. It makes it possible to change the behaviour and properties of tokens, token pairs, issuance, and deposit flows with few API calls or through the TokenD Admin Panel.
 
Intuitive REST API, SDKs and reference implementations of various modules, mobile wallets, and web applications significantly reduce the amount of resources needed to train a team with no experience in the development of blockchain applications.
