# Atomic Swaps

Atomic Swaps feature allows users to easily exchange tokens issued in the TokenD system with any other asset managed in external system. Such approach is highly useful for use cases where deposit of external system assets are not desirable due to legal limitations or UX requirements. Flow described in this document requires intermediate trusted entity, which will send confirmations of transfer in external system to the TokenD system.

1. Token issuer creates request to sell tokens using [ManageASSellRequest](/tech/sell_as.md). Specifying amount, token, price and identifier in external system. Amount of tokens specified in the request is locked on token issuer balance. Token issuer is able to cancel this request at any moment.
1. User willing to purchase token creates request specifying amount of tokens to be brought using [CreateASBuyRequest](/tech/buy_as.md). Corresponding amount of tokens is locked (locking period can be specified by admin of the system using [ManageKeyValueOp](/tech/manage_key_value.md)). Unique identifier is set for the request, which can be used to link transfer in external system with request in TokenD.
1. User performs transfer in external system specifying unique identifier of the request. (For systems, which use acquiring provider this step can be performed without need to provide user with ID of the request)
1. Intermediate system monitors requests from TokenD system using [/request](https://tokend.gitlab.io/horizon-docs/#reviewable-requests). In case of corresponding transfer in external system, this module approves the request and corresponding amount of tokens is transferred to the user via [ReviewRequestOp](/tech/review_request_op.md). This module is also responsible for rejections of the request in case of expiration.
1. User is able to see purchased token in her account.
