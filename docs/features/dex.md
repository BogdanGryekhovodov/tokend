# Decentralized Exchange*

In addition to supporting the issuing and movement of tokens, the TokenD system also allows to easily exchange them.
Its ledger stores both balances held by user accounts and offers that user accounts make to buy or sell assets.
Admin is able to manage if certain token pair is tradable. What is more it's also possible to specify restrictions on asset pair price (see `MANAGE_ASSET_PAIR_OP` for more details). Beside regular limit orders TokenD also provides crowdfunding tools, which allow token issuer to specify time period, price, soft and hardcap of the particular campaign.
