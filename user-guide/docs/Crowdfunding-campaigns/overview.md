# Overview

Since one of the options for users is to create and pre-issue their custom tokens, the platform is provided with the functionality allowing for a fully-fledged crowdfunding ecosystem, where users can explore and invest in the crowdfunding campaigns of others and, of course, create their own.

This material is devoted to the step-by-step guide on how users create their own crowdfunding campaigns _(If you want to learn more about the flow of investing in them, check user's [invest](../invest/overview.md) guide)._


## The purpose of a crowdfunding campaign

A user may create crowdfunding campaigns for many different purposes, starting from token sales and debt crowdfundings for raising funds, ending with the donation campaigns.
