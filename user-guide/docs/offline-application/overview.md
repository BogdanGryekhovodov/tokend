# Overview

Offline application is an important tool for token pre-issuance. It is used by both admins and corporate users on the platform.

With an offline application, you can:



*   [Generate a pre-issuance file ](./pre-issuance-file-generation.html)_(this file contains a transaction for token pre-issuance. A user will later upload this file to the platform to actually pre-issue the tokens.)_
* [View the existing pre-issuance files](./pre-issuance-file-review.html) public data
*  [Change the asset issuer](./change-asset-issuer.html) _(this operation is essential if the previous issuer – the one responsible for the creation of pre-issuance files – is no longer trusted due to any reason and you have to prevent him/her from being able to create the pre-issuance files)_
* [Generate a keyfile](./keyfile-generation.html) _(you can use this file to login to the offline application and sign the transactions)._
