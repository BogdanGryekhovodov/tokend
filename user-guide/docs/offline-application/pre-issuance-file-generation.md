# Pre-issuance file generation



1.  Run the offline application
1.  [Log in to the offline application](./login-to-the-offline-application.md)
1.  Go to the **Create **tab
1.  In the **Amount **box, enter the amount of asset you want to issue
1.  In the **Asset **box, enter the code of the asset you want to issue _(**Example: **USD, EUR, BTC, or any other custom token code)_
1.  Click **Create**
1.  Name the pre-issuance file and save it _(If required, you can [open the generated pre-issuance file](./pre-issuance-file-generation.md) in an offline application and view all the necessary details of pre-issuance)_

You will later upload this file on the platform to pre-issue the tokens. _**Note:** the [flow of a corporate user](../User-issued-tokens/the-two-ways-to-pre-issue-tokens.md#pre-issuance) and the flow of admin are different._

_**Note:** you can see your public key in the upper right corner of the offline application page._
