# Transfer tokens between the accounts

**Note: **you can transfer tokens of both system assets and user-issued assets, BUT only if they are transferable**. **Admins and corporate users define this parameter when creating the asset _(admin flow is described in system assets management, user flow â€“ in [custom tokens](../User-issued-tokens/overview.md))._

**Case example: **you want to transfer 10 user-issued CSTT tokens to another address.
