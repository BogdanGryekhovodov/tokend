# The two ways to issue tokens

The process of token issuance can also be classified as the distribution of tokens or the process of putting them into circulation. There are two basic ways a user can issue tokens on the platform (_**Note:** at this stage, the token should already be [created](./token-creation.html)_ _and_ _[pre-issued](./the-two-ways-to-pre-issue-tokens.html)):_



1.  [Issue coins manually](./manual-issuance.html) _(you manually issue (transfer) coins to the accounts of other users)_
1.  Create a crowdfunding campaign _(you create your tokensale, in which other users on the platform will have an opportunity to invest)_
