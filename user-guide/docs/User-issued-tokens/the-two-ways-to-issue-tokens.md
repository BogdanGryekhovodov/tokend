# Token issuance


The process of token issuance can also be classified as the distribution of tokens or the process of putting them into circulation. There are two basic ways a user can issue tokens on the platform (_**Note:** at this stage, the token should already be [created](./token-creation.html)_ _and_ _[pre-issued](./the-two-ways-to-pre-issue-tokens.html)):_



1.  [Issue coins manually](./manual-issuance.html) _(you manually issue (transfer) coins to the accounts of other users)_
1.  Create a crowdfunding campaign _(you create your tokensale, in which other users on the platform will have an opportunity to invest)_

## Manual issuance

This process implies that a user manually issues their tokens to the accounts of other users. 

**When does it make sense? **It depends on the business logic. Sometimes you don't need tokens for raising funds via tokensales. Instead, you can create your token and use it for the reconciliation of payments for your business/company. In such case, you would ask your clients/employees to register on the platform, so that you could transfer tokens to their accounts. 


## Step-by-step

_**Note:** at this stage, the token should already be [created](./token-creation.html) and_ _[pre-issued](./the-two-ways-to-pre-issue-tokens.html)._

1.  In the **Asset** box, select the asset you want to issue
1.  In the **Amount **box, enter the amount of coins to issue
1.  In the **Email **box, type the email of a receiver _(the email under which the account was registered. **Note: **be sure that the account you want to transfer token to actually exists in the platform)_
