A corporate user makes a token creation request; admin approves/disapproves this request.

_Note: Token creation is just an announcement that states the existence of a token and its properties on the platform. Actual coins are not issued at that point._


## Step-by-step:



1.  In the navigation bar, go to **Create token**
1.  In the **Upload icon**, upload an image from your computer that will be a primary logo for your token
1.  In the **Token name **box, type the name of the token _(**Example: **CustomToken)_
1.  In the **Token code **box, type the code of the token _(**Example: **CSTT)_
1.  In the **Max issuance amount **box, enter the maximum amount of coins to be issued _(**Example: **1000)_
1.  Select/clear the **Transferable **check box _(to learn more, check [properties of user-issued tokens](./properties-of-user-issued-tokens.html))_
1.  Select/clear the **Requires KYC **check box _(to learn more, [properties of user-issued tokens](./properties-of-user-issued-tokens.html))_
1.  In the **Upload terms, **upload the terms of use file _(a pdf document that states the terms of use for your token)_
1.  Select/clear the **I want to make additional issuance later **check box _(to learn more, check [two ways to pre-issue tokens](./the-two-ways-to-pre-issue-tokens.html))_
1.  In the **Pre-issued asset signer **box, enter the public key which will later be used to pre-issue the tokens _(**Note: **this step is essential only if you selected the **I want to make additional issuance later **check box)_
1.  In the **Initial pre-issued amount **box, enter the amount of coins that will be pre-issued automatically after admin approved the token creation request (You can set 0 as well. **_Note: this step is only essential if you selected the I want to make additional issuance later check box)_**
1.  Click **Submit** 
1.  Wait for the admin approval _(the flow on the part of admin is described in user tokens management. **Note: **you can [check the state of your request](./check-the-state-of-the-requests.html) and even [update it ](./update-the-token-creation-request.html) while it's pending)._

In case admin marked your request as **rejected **and described the **reject reason**, you can update it taking to attention the remarks of admin and submit the request again. 

If your request has been marked as **permanently rejected**, then you won't ever be able to create the token with the same asset code**.**
