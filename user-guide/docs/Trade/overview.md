## Place buy/sell orders

**Case example: **you have some of the CSTT user-issued tokens on your balance. You want to sell 8 CSTT tokens for 0.8 ETH, which means that you will ask 0.1 ETH per 1 CSTT:



1.  In the navigation bar, go to **Trade **
1.  In the **Asset **list in the upper-left corner of the page, select the asset pair: _CSTT/ETH (**Note**: you will only be able to trade this specific asset pair if admin has added it on the internal exchange)_
1.  Scroll down to the **Create sell order **form
1.  In the **Price per CSTT **box, enter the amount of ETH_ _you ask for 1 CSTT: _0.1 _
1.  In the **Amount of CSTT **box, enter the amount of CSTT you want to sell: _8_
1.  Check the **Total ETH **box: _0.8 (it will automatically calculate the amount of ETH you will get if the order is fulfilled)_
1.  Click **Sell **
1.  Click **Confirm**

Your order will appear in the order book among all other** bids** and will be updated automatically as other users will create the buy orders that match yours.

_**Note:** You can [cancel your order ](./cancel-an-open-order.html)at any time._
